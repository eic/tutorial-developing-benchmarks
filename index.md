Benchmarks are scripts that run detector simulations and analyze the resulting data to extract quantities related to the detector performance.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> The following tutorial assumes basic knowledge of shell. It may be practical to use eic-shell for benchmark development, as it is the environment that will closely match the one during benchmark execution. It also assumes that you are a member of the [EIC organization](https://github.com/eic/) on GitHub and belong to the "epic-devs" team. You also need to have your local ssh key added to GitHub so that you can push.
